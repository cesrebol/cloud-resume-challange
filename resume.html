        <p>
          Reliable, and resourceful <b>Cloud Engineer</b> with over 3 years working in software as a service. After I left the military I started to work for 
          a SaaS company based out of the Tampa Bay area. I worked in the Enterprise Sales Divivsion in the company where I helped generate new business for the organization.
          This is where my love for technology really started to gain traction again, as I have had a love for it in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since starting to work in tech, I enrolled in my local community college where I gained hands on experience with Cisco devices such as routers, switches, access points, and various other elements.
        I will be starting my Bachelors in Science of Computer Science at WGU in Jan 2023.
